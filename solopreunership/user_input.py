I started my career as a communications officer in the Air Force. 
There I was trained in effective communication(both written and spoken) and leadership skills.
I joined World Vision, the largest global non-profit organization, because I wanted to use my skills to help the others.
After spending nearly three years there, I decided to go back to coding because I wanted more hands on experience in software. 
I enjoyed writing code and workgin with other software engineers, but I learned that I was good at bridging the gap between tech and non-tech people.
I'm also passionate about helping people
